# Live-User-Filter

This project is a live user filter using the 'randomuser' API. It was built with CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. The application uses event listeners to filter the data based on user input. The filtered data is then displayed on the screen. The goal of this project is to provide an easy way to filter and find specific users from the API.
